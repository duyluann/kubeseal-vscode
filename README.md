# Kubeseal VSCode Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides easy integration with `kubeseal` for encrypting and decrypting Kubernetes secrets.

## Features

- **Encrypt Secrets**: Right-click on YAML files containing Kubernetes secrets to encrypt them using kubeseal
- **Decrypt Secrets**: Retrieve the original content of sealed secrets from your Kubernetes cluster
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: Encode and decode base64 values in Kubernetes secret data fields
- **Certificate Management**: Set and manage the path to your kubeseal certificate
- **Context Menu Integration**: Access kubeseal operations directly from the file explorer and editor context menus

## Requirements

> **Important:** You must have access to your Kubernetes cluster before using this extension, especially for decryption.

- `kubeseal` binary must be installed and accessible in your PATH
- `kubectl` binary must be installed and configured for cluster access
- For encryption: A kubeseal certificate file (`.pem`, `.crt`, or `.cert`)
- For decryption: Access to the Kubernetes cluster where the secret is deployed

## Installation

1. Install the `kubeseal` binary from [sealed-secrets releases](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases)
2. Install this extension from the VS Code marketplace
3. Configure the certificate path using the command palette: "Set Kubeseal Certificate Path"

## Usage

> **Note:** You must have access to your Kubernetes cluster before using the extension. Decryption will not work unless your `kubectl` is configured and you have the necessary permissions.

### Encrypting Secrets

1. Create a Kubernetes secret YAML file
2. Right-click on the file in the explorer or editor
3. Select "Encrypt with Kubeseal"
4. The encrypted file will be saved with `-sealed` suffix

### Decrypting Secrets

1. Right-click on a sealed secret YAML file
2. Select "Decrypt Secret"
3. The extension will retrieve the actual secret from your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`
4. The decrypted secret will be saved with `-unsealed` suffix

**Note**: This requires that:

- The sealed secret has been deployed to your cluster
- Your `kubectl` is configured to access the correct cluster
- You have permissions to read secrets in the target namespace

### Setting Certificate Path

- Use Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Set Kubeseal Certificate Path"
- Or configure in VS Code settings: `kubeseal.certPath`

### Base64 Encoding/Decoding

The extension provides utilities for working with base64 encoded values in Kubernetes secrets:

#### Encode Base64 Values

1. Right-click on a Kubernetes secret YAML file
2. Select **"Encode Base64 Values"**
3. All plain text values in the `data` field will be base64 encoded

#### Decode Base64 Values

1. Right-click on a Kubernetes secret YAML file
2. Select **"Decode Base64 Values"**
3. All base64 encoded values in the `data` field will be decoded to plain text

## Configuration

The extension provides the following settings:

- `kubeseal.certPath`: Path to the kubeseal certificate file
- `kubeseal.kubesealPath`: Path to the kubeseal binary (default: "kubeseal")

## Commands

- `kubeseal.encrypt`: Encrypt with Kubeseal
- `kubeseal.decrypt`: Decrypt Secret
- `kubeseal.setCertPath`: Set Kubeseal Certificate Path
- `kubeseal.encodeBase64`: Encode Base64 Values
- `kubeseal.decodeBase64`: Decode Base64 Values
